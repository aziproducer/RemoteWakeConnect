Binary file cannot be displayed as text. This appears to be an icon file (.ico).

Note: Since I cannot create actual binary icon files, you'll need to:
1. Add a proper .ico file to this location
2. Or use a default Windows icon
3. Or generate one using an icon creation tool

For now, I'll implement the tray icon functionality without the actual icon file.
